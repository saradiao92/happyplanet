# Introduction

The Happy Planet Index is a measure of sustainable well-being, evaluating countries by how efficiently they deliver long, happy lives for their residents using our limited environmental resources. HPI is designed to highlight the importance of sustainability and equity. It provides an approach to assess countries' achievements by investigating factors that contribute to human well-being other than traditional economic indicators. Our interest lies in identifying the happiest countries and understanding the key factors that make a country happy. Additionally, we aim to explore how these factors and happiness levels have changed over time.
