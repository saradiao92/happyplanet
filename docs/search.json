    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe Happy Planet Index is a measure of sustainable well-being, evaluating countries by how efficiently they deliver long, happy lives for their residents using our limited environmental resources. HPI is designed to highlight the importance of sustainability and equity. It provides an approach to assess countries’ achievements by investigating factors that contribute to human well-being other than traditional economic indicators. By analyzing regions, population, life expectancy, carbon emission, and GDP, HPI highlights what truly matters to our well-being in terms of long, happy, and meaningful lives. Our project aims to uncover patterns and relationships between these variables, and help find a balance between well-being, resource consumption, and material circumstances. Through this analysis, we will share deeper insights for global happiness.",

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nThe data set selected is from the Happy Planet Index (HPI) provided by HotorCool. It contains rankings for countries from 2006-2021 based on data from the corresponding years. For year, the data set includes columns HPI rank, Country, ISO, Continent, Population, Life Expectancy, Ladder of Life (Wellbeing), Carbon Footprint, CO2 threshold, GDP per capita, and HPI. For the latest 2024 data set, Life Expectancy data is sourced from the UN Population Division’s World Population Prospects 2022, updated periodically based on demographic projections. Ladder of Life scores are collected annually by Gallup World Poll through surveys of around 1,000 individuals per country, asking respondents to rate their life satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10, with results weighted to match national demographics. Carbon Footprint data is taken from the World Inequality Database, providing per capita estimates based on national accounts, and GDP per capita comes from global financial institutions like the World Bank. Some missing values are imputed using adjacent years, creating uncertainty, while survey sampling limitations and time lags in the 2024 rankings may affect accuracy.\nThe data set is provided in a excel format. We save the data sheet for each year as a csv file and integrate the data sets from 2006 to 2021 to one in R.",

The year 2006 marks the inception of the survey, while 2021 represents the latest available data. Rows with HPI scores of 0, indicating missing values, were excluded to ensure an accurate analysis of the distribution patterns.\nThe data reveals notable variability in HPI scores across the years. In 2006, the distribution is slightly right-skewed, with a noticeable peak around 30-40. By 2011, the distribution becomes more symmetrical, with most scores concentrated between 30 and 50. In 2016, the distribution shifts slightly upward, showing a higher concentration in the range of 35-50. However, in 2021, the distribution shifts downward, with most scores falling between 25 and 50.\nThis analysis underscores the dynamic nature of global well-being over time, reflecting shifts in sustainable well-being and life satisfaction across countries.",

In many cases, the green dots (mean scores) and blue dots (2021 scores) are closely aligned, indicating consistency in performance across years. However, in some instances, a noticeable gap exists between the two points, suggesting either a decline or improvement in HPI in recent years. For example, Sweden shows a significant increase in 2021 compared to its mean score.\nThis visualization provides valuable insights into the happiest countries globally. By further investigating these nations, we can explore the traits or policies contributing to their high HPI. Additionally, the plot reveals that most countries with high HPI scores are concentrated in Europe and Asia, which brings us to the next question: What is the variance of HPI across continents.",

In contrast, unhappy countries display longer right tails for carbon footprint, which aligns with the notion that excessive carbon emissions negatively impact quality of life. A significant proportion of unhappy countries also have extremely low GDP per capita, highlighting economic challenges. Interestingly, while many unhappy countries have low carbon footprints, others exhibit exceptionally high levels. Low carbon footprints might be attributed to a lack of industrial technology, resulting in fewer machines and lower levels of industrial activity.",

    "text": "This result suggests that economic factors or material circumstances is not the only priority for a country even though many traditional ideas support it. For better human-being, there are other more important indicators we need to care about. Overall, happy countries tend to have these characteristics: - have long life expectancy - have higher ladder of life - be relatively wealthier - have not too much carbon emissions Of course, this research cannot represent the whole pattern. However, at least from this result, wealth and carbon emissions are highly related. If the country is very rich, then carbon emissions might be the byproduct of technology development. A moderate level of wealth is enough for people to have a happy life. Focusing solely on the pursuit of money will not guarantee greater human happiness.\n\nLimitations:\n\nLimited Number of Factors:\n\nThe analysis only considers six primary factors (GDP, population, life expectancy, wellbeing, carbon footprint, and regions), potentially overlooking other important determinants of happiness.\n\nLack of Specific Country Focus:\n\nThe analysis does not narrow down to individual countries, which could provide deeper insights into localized factors influencing happiness.\n\n\n\nFuture Directions:\n\nDeeper Analysis of Regional Trends:\n\nFocus on specific regions or countries to understand unique drivers of happiness.\nExplore cultural, political, and environmental factors influencing happiness in these areas.\n\nPolicy Recommendations:\n\nDevelop some data-driven suggestions for governments and organizations to enhance happiness.\nExplore targeted policies that address key drivers such as health, income inequality, and environmental sustainability.\n\nIncorporate Additional Factors:\n\nInclude variables like income, education quality, family condition, and mental health resources.\nExamine how these factors interact with existing drivers of happiness.",
